# /llmdoc:update

Use this command when repository changes require tracked `llmdoc/` knowledge to be verified or synchronized.

Load the `llmdoc` skill before broad exploration. CLI commands below run as `npx -y @tokenroll/llmdoc <cmd>`.

## Authorization

An explicit `/llmdoc:update` invocation authorizes this run to:

- read repository state and existing llmdoc docs
- write impacted `llmdoc/` documents and `llmdoc/meta.json`
- write temporary investigation reports under `.llmdoc-tmp/investigations/`
- read and resolve declared reflection candidates under `.llmdoc-tmp/reflections/`

This command does not authorize source-code edits.

## Preconditions

- `git status -- llmdoc/` must be clean before the first formal write.
- Rollback means `git checkout -- llmdoc/` (plus deleting any newly created files under `llmdoc/`); never hand-edit files back.
- If `validate` fails after writes and cannot be repaired in-run, roll back the doc write-set before reporting failure.

## Workflow

1. Measure the current doc state.
   - Run `status`.
   - Run `delta` with any explicit scope flags.
   - Read each explicitly declared `--reflection` candidate. When the flag has no paths, read all Markdown candidates directly under `.llmdoc-tmp/reflections/pending/`. A pending candidate is an update signal even when code delta is empty.

2. Gate reflection candidates before promotion.
   - Require a verifiable trigger, wrong assumption or action, root cause, preventive rule, scope, confidence, and existing-doc match.
   - Verify repository claims against code, tests, or stable docs. User corrections prove intent, not repository facts.
   - Reject transient tool failures, one-task preferences, and unverified speculation. Use `search` and targeted `show` to find an existing owner before creating a document.

3. Choose the lightest sufficient path from delta plus any qualified candidates.
   - Light: owners are mapped and facts are clear.
   - Deep: files are unmapped, owner/root cause is unclear, boundaries changed, facts conflict, or impact is broad.
   - This choice controls evidence gathering only. It does not decide whether prose must change.
   - For unmapped or moved code and boundary changes, read [Knowledge Topology and Context Floor](../llmdoc/references/knowledge-topology.md) and classify each surface as missing mapping, missing owner, or intentional no-doc.

4. Decide the semantic outcome with `recorder`.
   - Treat `delta` and candidates as review evidence, not a write list or prose to copy.
   - Rewrite only false/incomplete claims or new conclusions that pass the Stable Knowledge Gate. Reflection candidates must pass both gates.
   - Gate prose and routing independently; true prose may still need routing metadata repair.
   - If the document remains true and the change adds only reconstructable evidence, mark it verified unchanged.
   - Light: `recorder` decides from targeted CLI reads. Deep: `investigator` reports evidence, then `recorder` applies the gate.
   - Scaffold brand-new docs with `new`; register docs that already exist as files with `adopt <path...>` — never hand-edit `meta.json` or recreate the file through `new`.

5. Finalize.
   - If document identities changed, read [Startup Configuration](../llmdoc/references/startup-config.md). `mv` syncs renames; sync manual merges or deletions before validation.
   - Run `validate`; after mapping or boundary changes, also run the reference's scoped routing acceptance.
   - If prose changed, run `commit -m "<message>"`, adding `--verified <path...>` for reviewed unchanged docs. If all stayed unchanged, run `commit --verified <path...>`. Full verification uses `--all`, never with `--verified`.
   - `commit` validates, commits prose, refreshes fingerprints, and lands `meta.json` separately. Never reconstruct this sequence manually or `--amend` it.
   - Dirty mapped source makes `commit` fail closed; commit or clean that source, then retry.
   - After success, `N commits behind HEAD, metadata-only; knowledge clean` reflects the meta follow-up commit, not staleness.

6. Fold durable lessons into stable docs directly.
   - Put reusable cautions, invariants, and workflow fixes into the relevant architecture or guide docs.
   - Reflection candidates are a temporary evidence queue, not a tracked reflection kind or a second knowledge tree.
   - On `success`, resolve consumed candidates. On `no_change`, resolve only already-covered or rejected candidates. Leave them pending after `incomplete` or `failed`.

## State Invariants

- Full successful updates may advance the repository baseline.
- Scoped updates must update only per-document fingerprints, not the global baseline.
- Update never changes convergence state. If growth requires convergence, finish update and ask once before running the separate prune workflow.

## Result Contract

- `success`: the declared scope was semantically verified, any necessary prose changes were committed, and applicable revisions advanced.
- `no_change`: the declared scope was already current, so neither prose nor revision state needed to change.
- `dry_run`: the user asked for a dry run, or only status/delta/investigation/planning output was produced without writing `llmdoc/`; do not advance state.
- `incomplete`: evidence was insufficient, user input is required, or the scope belongs to a different explicit maintenance workflow; roll back writes and do not advance state.
- `failed`: update failed and doc writes were rolled back.

Always report:

- the chosen path (`light` or `deep`) and why
- the `status` and `delta` signals used
- any investigation report path
- each reflection candidate and its disposition (`promoted`, `already_covered`, `dismissed`, or `pending`)
- the stable docs changed and the docs verified unchanged by `recorder`
- routing classifications and checks when topology changed
- the `commit` result — validate gate, fingerprint refresh, and the meta follow-up commit — or why finalization was skipped
